# This Repository is WIP.

## How to use:

>python main.py

or download the [latest release](https://github.com/Gnarmagon/NoNpDRM-Converter/releases)

## How to compile:

>conda install pip

>pip install pyinstaller

Run the compile.bat.

In the "dist" folder is the .exe that has to be in a folder with pkg_dec.exe and the input.txt

## Coming soon:

- Linux support (hopefully)

- A Qt based gui

- Faster code (maybe)

- removing unneeded manuals (replacing it with a dummy.png) to make the games smaller

- generating zRif's from NoNpDRM-Dumps

- give all Title ID's a name

## Issues:
My brain is 90% of the time afk but if you want you can open an issue and tag it with bug :)
